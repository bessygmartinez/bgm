                <p> I'm from Miami, FL, but I design and build in the digital world, having earned a
                    full stack web development certification from the University of Miami and a degree in
                    Graphic/Commercial Design from Miami-Dade College. I'm fascinated by the connection between
                    UX and UI design, and my work as a developer is continuously expanding. </p>
