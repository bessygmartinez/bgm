                <h2>Hi, I'm Bessy!</h2>
                <p>I'm from Miami, FL, but I design and build in the digital world.
                    Earned my full stack web development certificate from the University of Miami, 
                    but have been fascinated by software and computers since I first laid hands on one back in 1993.</p>
                <p>My personal interests include pop culture, beer, live music, anime, and cosplay. I'm also
                    a sucker for a really great showtune.
                </p>
